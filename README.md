## App Description
This app allows you to search for food in and around Ann Arbor. The app loads a menu and a map. You can click markers on the map to see what option is available there or you can click an option from the side to learn more about it. You can also narrow down the options using the searchbar on the side, which updates the side menu and map markers in real time.

This app uses the Google Maps API and the Four Square API.
